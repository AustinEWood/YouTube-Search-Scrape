        "Video Transcript": "as you know my name is kaint on the tech pro and in this complete tutorial i'm going to be taking you on windows server administration step by step with no step skip right from beginning to the end and this is the setup we are going to be using you can see right here on the screen so you can see we have five notes i'm going to be using for this demo and one interesting thing about this demo is that you can actually do it right at home if you simply have a wi-fi you can set it up at home even without the wi-fi you can use our visual box this very tutorial will be done using visual box so i'm going to be using uh installing visual machines in a visual box setting the ip address the configuration and everything i'm going to be taking you through now let me just show you the step-by-step now if you go to my website you can actually see the step-by-step of these demos so let me just show you because it's better you have the steps and you'll be able to follow it yourself and that is what i do every time now if you are joining me for the first time you need to subscribe subscribe to my channel so that you don't miss any update from me now this is my website if you go to my website you find a whole lot of free lessons free tutorials and books and courses that you can get uh for free now this is what we are talking about so we are going to be starting from part one how to set up active directory with visual box step by step so these steps we are going to be following now i'm going to move these to the second screen so that it doesn't distract me so let's get started right now so the first step i'm going to okay let me just show you for a second what the first step is so the first type requires that we download our visual box we download and install visual box and also download windows server and windows 10 windows server can be downloaded from here and what you need to download is the iso if you download the iso so if you come you can say the iso v8d and so so download download the iso for windows server 2019 as well as windows 10 save the two isos in a folder on your system i'm going to show you in my local system where i actually saved the two isos now if i go to my drive in my system my document and i actually downloaded these two items and saved them so if i go to you can see uh let me see i saw vad no sync so you can see the try items you are going to be using so without wasting time let's dive right in let me open up the visual box and let's get started so i'm going to open up visual box c a visual box again remember to subscribe like and share my video leave me a comment if you have any challenges whatsoever following my lessons please leave me a comment in the comment box below this video as well so the first thing you want to do is to click on new ones you click on new enter the name so according to the steps we are following we have the name of the server is going to be dc is going to be our domain controller and we have node 1.2 node 3 and node 4. so let's go to site the name of the server is going to be dc for domain controller and you're going to choose windows server 2019 64 bit that's what i'm using i'm going to leave it at 2 2 0 4 8 leave everything at default leave everything as default now you can pause the video and read the explanation on the screen so this is not an explanation of everything but i'm going to be taking you through and explaining what is necessary now 50 50 gb for the hard disk for the visual hard disk for this machine so simply create so once you create it you simply power it on so you can right click and click on normal start or simply click on this green button here start now this is where you are going to select the visual uh the iso you downloaded so i'm going to start by going to add and choosing windows server 2019 iso and click on open and click on choose and click on start so that is basically what you need to do and then it's going to start the normal setup of windows for now everything looks small so let me just go to scaled mode yeah so that it becomes a little bigger later we are going to be installing um vish or additions i think visual box additions or something like that to be able to help us expand or increase the size of the screen so i'm going to go nice we're going to install and nothing you want to do takes a little while all right so choose the second one or windows or windows server 2019 desktop experience standard evaluation desktop fc experience and the next screen you are going to choose are custom install so accept the license go next and choose custom install and go next as well so it installs windows server 2019 while it is installing we are going to start adding the next visual machine and i'm going to add these to be node one i'm going to call it node one sorry so okay i clicked on cancel so i'm gonna call it node one so i'm gonna call it node node one and now i'm going to also choose windows server 2019 64-bit you can also choose windows 10 for me i want to install the servers first at this time so i'm going to click on next everything i'm leaving it the same continue continue uh continue 50 gig is okay and i'm going to power it on as well now it's going to drag my cpu so i'm going to kind of um maybe yeah this is fine so i'm going to let's choose add and choose windows 10 windows 2 server 2099 so choose and then so now it doesn't allow me to start maybe because the other one is running so let me just take it out yes so let's remove it we are going to add it later on so let's check the status of this so this is still installing our server is still installing at this point but there is nothing wrong let's uh create the nodes node one is going to be windows server 2019 i'm going to create the nodes but i'm not going to start the the machine i'm going next next next next next next okay i'm going to also create another node it's going to be node 2. now you can actually choose windows 10 but for me i'm going to continue choosing windows server 2019 again i'm going next next [Music] sorry for that destruction [Music] hello okay all right so let's go ahead to create another node so i'm going to click on new this time i'm going to say note 3 i'm going to choose windows server 2019 i'm going to click continue i'm going to click on continue i'm going to click on continue and then uh continue as well continue so for now we've created all the nodes we want the laptop i added in the in the in the architecture i showed you can be actually added later on so let's check the status of this installation so you can see it is still installing as you can see right here so let's just wait for a couple of minutes so once it completes the installation is going to restart and then we are good to go so at this point we are going to enter the password so i'm going to choose a password request complex password um retype the passwords all right so it's going to finalize installation after this installation the next thing you want to do is to install uh visual box additions or something like that so first let me just go to impute and choose keyboard and choose control alt delete and then i'm going to enter the same login i created and then it logs in so you are going to go to okay allow a few seconds to start and you are going to all right so at this point go to devices go to optical drive visual visual box guest additions that's the name so say yes yes it's okay and let's go back to devices choose inserts so this visual box guest addition is going to allow you to be able to to maximize the screen and be able to make the screen feel uh i adjust the screen size to feel to be full screen so for some reason uh okay so let's go back here i'm going to devices optical devices choose these and go to devices inside all right so it comes up like this and choose run visual box additions and go next go next go next so it's going to install the guest additions and then you go you're going to restart while that is happening i'm going to the same area install go to node one and go to okay before we do the network settings let's just complete one thing at a time so let's allow it so it's going to reboot so while it's rebooting now we are going to set the network setting in such a way that this virtual machine is going to connect with the host as well as other virtual machines to be able to achieve that go to the virtual machine settings and go to the network and choose briefs adapter should bring the adapter and say okay that is fine so let's get back here i'm going to log in again by saying keyboard uh insert ctrl alt delete all right so here we go at this point i can now increase uh or maximize or i can adjust the screen size to full screen meanwhile it's going to be full screen auto resize that is fine so allow a few seconds and it's going to assume a full screen but the font is really the the display is really very small so you are going to right click and go to display settings and just change it to 200 percent so on the scale the layout you are going to choose 200 percent and okay so problem solved so at this point we are going to install the second virtual machine so i'm going to go back here and start startup node one so i'm going to click on start and we are going to choose uh windows our 2019 next start as well all right so let's take some time but it's okay so basically the same process so i may just speed it up as well so let me just go next install now all right so while the second um the second the second of a machine is installing let's now configure the domain controller as domain controller all right according to the instruction to be able to configure a domain controller you need to add a role so you are you are going to click on add roles and features and the feature you are going to add will be active directory directory services so i'm going to go next uh go next again and uh okay there is one thing i'd like us to do before we do this i'm going to cancel for now so i would like to change the name of this computer so i'm going to go to this pc i'm going to go to this computer i would like to change the name so i'm going to properties i like to change the name from change settings and change the name to to dc all right so i'm going to say okay so it requires that we restart the system so i'm going to restart that is fine so let's check this status of the other one not this one okay while this one is still installing our domain controller restarts so it restarts and i'm going to go to impute keyboard control alt deletes i'm going to login and now we want to set up the system as a domain controller okay so to do that we need to add roles in server manager you are going to click on add roles or features so let's wait for a second so here we are going to click on add roles and features the role we are going to add is server manager is collecting inventory okay this is fine so let's go here go to next next next it's fine and we are going to add active directory directory services rule so we are going to look for active directory active directory directory services active directory domain services yeah so we are going to click on active directory domain services so i'm going to add features um so we are missing nothing okay i'm going to go next okay so you can actually select this if you want so i'm going next next uh alternate installation parts no i'm going to just install it's actually active directory domain services so let's check the second installation to see where we are okay so it's still installing okay at this point i like to close this power point because it seems to be a destruction so i'm going to just go to powerpoint close this is fine this is installing okay for the second nodes are which we are installing so we are going to uh because installation just completed so we are simply going to uh set it up as usual by creating a username and a password for this system i'm changing the name of the computer to node or node one so this is still installing uh the active directory domain services and this is starting up okay so node 1 you can see node 1 is starting up and we are going to simply set the username on the uh we are simply going to cite the password for node1 alright so i'm going to choose a password all right so i'm going to go to impulse keyboard control alt delete and enter the password and it's going to start as usual we're also going to say uh set up the uh visual box guest additions so simply go to devices optical drive should be this one and go a second time inside guest additions so hopefully it's going to pop up and allow us to ins it says inside guest addition disk in south extradition so this point i will reboot this system and i'm going to visual box and set up node 2 so i'm going to start node 2 at this point i'm going to choose the os to be windows server 2019 iso i'm going to click on start this time is server 2 now and now many things are running but it's ok so these are server node 1 and node one we are going to go to first let's login and then we set it to full screen so first and we now set it to full screen so i'm going to go to view full screen uh full screen so let's wait for a while it's going to automatically resize to full screen so it resizes itself to full screen and the next thing we want to do oh sorry it's no problem so sometimes here on the way so let's just take all this uh let's just resize this to full screen so let's change the display setting to big uh to change this scale up the size a bit to 200 percent and this is fine the hub node 1 unknown 2 set up now let's go back to visual box and we are going to settings of node 2 and we are going to also change the network to breeze adapter as well all right so let's check ah give me a second let's see okay so active directory domain services installed completely in the dc so we are going to close and it requires that we restart the dc so i'm going to go to dc and simply restart the dc all right so let's check our note one uh no this is not one is okay and this is not two so we need to continue setup of node 2. so node 1 is ok it's ready node 2 is what is getting set up at this point and also our domain controller is also ready as a domain controller there is for a little bit we still need to do so i'm going next custom install it's going to be uh it's going to be next okay so there's something i need to explain to you now let's first check our domain controller to make sure it's fine so i'm gonna i'm going here to impute control deletes so hopefully i think i'm in the domain controller at this point so you can simply go to local server you go to local server you can see there is a dc now if you go to tools right here you can go to active directory users and computers right here we go to active directory users on computers it says to manage groups uh to manage users and groups on this computer use local users and group to manage users and groupon in the domain login as as a user we domain administrator right perfect okay there is something we still need to do all right now if you look at this place it says something we need to promote this server to a domain controller that's the next step we need to follow so promote the server to the main controller we are going to create a new forest because you have this question here that say select the deployment operation so we are going to promote the server to a domain controller and we are going to create a new forest the root domain is going to be ktg so you can choose any domain name any name you like dot local is always good to ask that look how if you are working with a local domain if the system you are configuring is your local domain so i'm going to click on next um it says type the directory services restore modes passwords um okay no problem we are going to do it it's necessary all right so uh i'm going to click on next uh dnas for now leave the dns is going to create is on a dns by itself the knight bios domain name should normally i leave it at as the domain name without the local suffix so that's fine ktg is fine so at this point this computer which we named dc becomes our domain controller for this domain okay and go to next install so while we wait for it to complete the installation let's just go to uh this should be node one which is okay and let's look look at node two which was currently installing and still installing for this node one here this computer here which is node one for you to be able to join the domain there are some things we need to do i'm gonna tell you uh first we have to allow the domain controller to complete each installation now i have a step by step in case you can also follow the step by step my um all right so let's configure node one to be able to join this domain we are going to do that first okay so this is fine close now that the domain controller has been set up as domain controller uh we are going to it's going to actually restart the system and the system will now be the domain controller will be to now be part of the domain so it takes a couple of seconds but let's check the other installation this is fine this is continuing to install as well let's just go back so while it's continues um let's take this one let's check this one okay so this is fine it's restarting so maybe we just complete the note 2 installation at this point before we uh continue all right anyway let's check the domain controller so here we have the domain controller still trying to apply settings it takes a while and in case of nodes 2 is coming up so let's wait for a second as well all right so let's enter the passwords or let's choose a password all right this is fine and i'm going to login so impute keyboard control delete and we simply log in that's fine so let's check out domain controller is still applying settings that is fine node one is okay it's just waiting for us to configure it to join the domain unknown 2 is coming up to speed um going to devices optical drives i'm going to say vbox guest additions and also again inside vbox guest addition image this is going to allow us to scale this display size of the of the guests of the visual machine to be able to feel the screen so let's check what is happening here this is still applying settings and this is coming up okay so we are going to remember we need to set the network settings for all of them to be bridge connection so let's just check let's just verify i'm going to settings network read the adapter that is fine go to node 1 settings as well and check that it's break off so it's going to it has a bridge adapter okay and finally checkpoint two settings and it's going to be breeze adapter so all of them are okay so these node two trying to come up and uh so now i've mixed up the whole thing so okay so this is not two this is not two so let's do the guest additions here i think i first need to go the optical drive the installations and then i insert guest addition see the image and then it comes up i'm going to click on it and say wrong go into next next next install so while it's installing and restarting in note 2 let's go check the act the active directory is the main controller i still coming up and in case of this we are going to now restart the system so since we don't have all the time we have dc we have not won and we have no two i'd like to now give you an assignment please set up note 3 yourself so no 2 comes up at this point so we are going to login and then set it to full screen so i'm going to come to login with the passwords and say okay and it comes up and i'm going to go to view and simply set it to full screen i set it to full screen i'm going to wait for a few seconds and it's going to switch to full screen mode after some time and that is fine and again we need to scale the display let me just close this and scale the display settings to be to be 200 percent just to make the the uh the icons to be bigger all right so we have our node one we have node two this is not one the two and then this is our domain controller how do i know if we go to this we can see that it now tells you ktg administrator so it's the main controller or is right inside the domain uh you can it cannot be outside the domain so i'm going to login with the same password all right so now we have all the systems off we have this one we have this one and give me one second let me just check to make sure everything is fine so we have this one i'm going to go to um i'm going to go to this sorry let me just come here and check so this computer if i go to local server the name is whatever you can see it's name here so i'm going to close so let's change the name to node one or before we change the name to node one uh we are going to change the setting to be able to see the the active directory uh domain controller so let's first get the ip address because for for you to be able to connect system to the active directory to be on the same network you'll need to set the client's dna dns server to be the ip address of the domain controller so we need to know the domain controller's ip address so i'm going to use cm cmd to say ipconfig the ip address says 192.168.1.90 all right so in this case now i'm going to come here and go to the network settings of this system and set it to and set the dna to 192.168.1.90 so i'm going to go to change adapter options i'm going to right click on this one and go to properties and one thing you should do is to disable the ip protocol version 6 and then go to version 4 and go to properties and use the following dns 192.168.1.90 and alternate dns you can just put anything there and say okay and close right all right now we are going to allow the system to join the domain so i'm going to go to this computer of course i need to know which system is this so this is not one so i'm going to go to this computer i'm going to this pc and go to properties now we are going to configure it to join the domain to do that simply go to change settings and go to change i'm going to change the name as well to node1 before we do that there is one thing we need to do go to remote and set allow remote connection so this system and also we need to change the firewall settings so that will be able to uh to allow connections coming in so i'm going to change the firewall settings more like i'm going to turn off the firewall so that they are the the the domain controller i'll be able to connect to the system and at this point i'm going to go the computer name i'm going i'm going to change i'm going to call it node1 and the domain is ktgg.local ktg dot lookup and i'm going to say ah there's something we need to do first once we have created the domain we need to create a user account in this domain so i'm going to go to my i'm going to tools and go to active directory users and computers i'm going to create a user that have a privilege to join systems onto the domain so we need to create a user that have a privilege to join our computers onto this domain so go to users right click and say new new user and i'm going to use my name and the username is going to be kind sound okay i'm going next and the passwords and then i don't want to use us to change the password so let me just go next finish so we've created a user and that is fine so we are going to use this user now to join the system to the domain so i'm going to come here and say okay so it's going to ask us to specify a user that has um a user that has privilege to join to domain so it's going to be kind son and say okay so node one it says welcome to ktg.local domain somewhere okay i'm going to say okay as well i'm going to close and it's going to prompt us to restart the system i'm going to restart uh we are going to also to node 2 and we are going to do the same thing first we are going to set the dns ip to point to the domain controller ip so i'm going to first i'm going to turn off the firewall firewall i'm going to turn it off all right so turn off firewall from here turn off turn off as well say okay okay next i'm going to go to alternates and change let's click on this sorry not here i'm going to right click or change adapter options and right click on the adapter and choose properties remember you go to you have to turn off ipv version 6 and configure ipv4 in this case we are changing the properties to cite the dna server address to point to the domain controller so i'm going to say 192.168.1.90 alternate dns can be anything and say okay and close and next we would like to let me just close up this windows as well next we would like to uh allow remote connections to this computer so i'm gonna go to properties properties uh go to change settings remotes allow remote connections okay apply computer name and just go to change here and give it nodes to and we are going to join domain ktg dot local and say okay this is okay so i think i mixed the i miss the password so i'm going to say okay um say okay as well i'm going to close and i'm going to restart this system so now we've been able to join the two systems onto the domain how do we know that we've joined the system to the domain we are going to go to the domain controller and we are going to go to tools and go to active directory users and computers and go to computers so you can see node 1 and node 2. so if you've come up to this point thumbs up to you i'm going to stop here for now so that in the next part we are now going to see how to set permissions and see other things we can do in a domain for now if you right click on the system you can see a number of things you can do you can manage uh you can do remote desktop you can do just a whole lot of things including installing applications onto the system so we are going to be gradually looking into all these things you can do on windows server administration 2019 so i'm going to stop here i'm kind of on the tech pro remember to subscribe to my channel if you've not subscribed and also leave me a comment if you have any question whatsoever"

        "Video Name": "Day#1 Windows Server 2019 Administration Bootcamp What is Server?",
        "Video ID": "6wU101ialgQ",
        "Video Transcript": "okay so this link that you see here this is the it fundamentals and this basically teaches you the basics of i.t if you don't have deep knowledge about it fundamentals and you don't really know a lot of things about the concepts you can go into this link and this is comptia it fundamentals um and uh this is 37 videos so you can start learning this while we are learning our server 2090 boot camp so now what i will do is i will quickly start the introduction about windows server 2019 before we start windows server 2019 one thing that i would like to do is i would like to say is what most of the times right now most of us is using computers right we have computers at home we have computers in office we have computers in anywhere you go so and those computers that we have basically they have an operating system right the operating system is installed so basically you see right now i have this start menu i have this task bar and this is part of my operating system so all computers that we see they actually have operating system installed when it comes to operating system um operating system comes into two different types for example one of them is like end user operating system end user operating system is for example windows 10 windows 7 windows xp they are all uh end user operating system end user who is end user this person that you see here in this picture he is the user of this computer he is going to use this computer that's why he is called he can be called end user he can be called and user so basically we can call call them what call them end user so and then we have another operating system which is called server operating system and one is for end user and one is for client so if i come here let me quickly um draw something here for you so so when it comes to operating system one is called um for example end user operating system and the other one is server operating system if you remember we did learn about the differences um of what is server and what the server do what is the job of server the job of the server is to provide services so what is the job of server the job of the server is to provide services so what we do with server server provides services right so today if we ask what is this server what is a server we basically can have a lot of different answers for it server is a computer so you see here this this is a server room this is a server room and then in here we have these different racks so these things the black things that you see here they all call racks rack racks and then if you see here you may see some servers here installed so server is exactly same as computers the desktops that you have at home or in office but server is a machine server is a machine which is bigger and powerful server is a machine which is bigger and powerful so if i show you some pictures here so if i go to google and i say power edge servers this is one of the models that we have so you see it is a computer it is a computer it is like a computer but but if you see it is what it is a computer but it is bigger it is powerful and it is expensive right so you see these are all different servers it is like a computer so if someone asks you a question what is a server a server is a machine that is powerful and it provides services it provides services right so that is a server that is a server that we use in our daily life when we work somewhere anywhere you go if you go and work in a office they will have a server room like this you see this is like a server room and then they will have servers installed why because these computers you see one computer two three four five if they want to share files right if they want to access files if they want to access files they need a server if they want to send an email they need a server if you want to access a website you need a server correct so today we have what we have google.com what is google.com it is a website where is this website this website is in a web server you see web server so all websites for example google.com gmail hotmail yahoo all of them are web servers so web server provides services what kind of services it allows access to the websites that's how you access websites then we have email server this is email server most of you have gmail.com hotmail.com yahoo.com addresses so who is doing this email routing for example when you send an email from one person to another person right who is doing this sending and receiving how are you sending and receiving emails you are using a email server right you are using an email server so let me quickly show you hotmail.com data center i will quickly show you uh something here so you see this is microsoft's data center this is also microsoft's data center most of you have hotmail accounts and those accounts are actually where they are stored in here so they these servers that you see most of you have your emails stored somewhere here so that's how email servers work that's how email servers work all right any questions you have up to here all right so when we talk about um operating system um when we talk about operating system we are basically talking about two kind of operating systems so one operating system so whenever we have like os what is os whenever you work in it you will hear this term a lot like everyone will say hey what is your os what is your os you you you should know what is os os means operating system right and then whenever we talk about operating system we basically um have how many uh kind of operating systems we have different kinds of operating systems we have for example end user os and end user os let's go back um to like 19 80 1990 so basically let's just start with windows for example let's start with windows xp and then windows 7 windows vista windows 8 windows 10 so these are all end user operating system end user operating system so these are called end user operating system because we install it where where do we install where do we usually install these operating systems like in what hardware do we install these operating systems do you know we install it in laptops or desktops right so we install it in laptops or desktops so whenever you have a laptop you will have like windows 10. do you know what operating system is installed in your computer right now windows 10 who doesn't know who doesn't know who doesn't know how to check so let's just say i ask you hey can you please tell me what operating system is installed in your computer how can you tell how can you how can you do that um who doesn't know so those who already know that's good if you don't know how to when you go to start menu if you type this pc and if you right click on this pc and go to properties so basically it will give you all the information device name this is my computer name this is the installed ram and this is the processor this is windows specification so there are two specifications this is for hardware for example if you have a laptop which is dell it will tell you that and then if you have windows specification you see i have windows 10 pro and the version is 20 hs and the build is this much so so basically if you check on your iphone right an iphone you have ios and then you have different versions in your samsung phone you have a different version of operating system same thing here now if i ask you hey can you please tell me what is your operating system that is how you will do it and if i ask you hey what is the ram installed in your computer and what is the processor in your computer this is how you can check this is how you can check easily right this is how you can check easily so everyone who actually doesn't know how to do it need try it once okay so try it once try to see the specifications of your operating system of your device so so you know how to check the name the processor the ram and what operating system is installed in your computer so this way you will know if you don't know right and there is another uh thing that we can use um it's called if you click on start menu and type system information if you click on start menu and type system information system information will also give you all the details so when you go to system information it will give you version operating system and a lot of other details that you need okay so this is how you can check now if i ask you ask you that hey can you please give me the system information about your pc like what operating system is installed what is the name of your computer and what is the processor what is the ram this is how you do it so you see you have a lot of different details about cd-rom about display about modem about network about printing about usb basically all hardware and software information about your computer you can have it through this system information correct so this is how you can do it so end user operating systems are what windows xp 7 vista and so on now we have other one it's called server operating systems i have already uh shown you the server how they look like they are big machines powerful and the operating system that you use we were we were using uh operating system called windows server 2000 windows server 2003 windows server 2008 windows server 2012 windows server 2016 and today we have windows server 2019 so 2019 is the latest server operating system and we are going to learn about server 2019 and windows 10. so we will be learning about both of them windows server 2000 2003 2008 they are already expired they are retired they are no longer supported by microsoft right they are no longer supported by microsoft correct so these are different operating systems that we have correct so this is how the server is so this is the server server is to provide services server provides services right they are powerful machines they are powerful machines you see they are powerful machines they are big they are expensive do you know how much is one server do you know how much is one server who knows how much is one server yeah you bought one for 200 it depends you bought one 200 because it was used and it was not the latest model but the servers that you see here they are around 2 500 2 000 or or maybe less depending on how much powerful operating system how much powerful server you want right how much powerful server you want i will teach you how to choose a good server again you see these are different computers they are connected with server and that's how you access files that's how you access emails if i ask you now why do we need server what do you think what why do we need server what if we don't have server what do you think what if we don't have server we don't use server and we just use computers what do you think yes so when you want central administration you want security that's the time when we need a server so it provides service so in most offices when you go you have a boss right you have a manager you have a supervisor so that supervisor is actually leading or is a boss of like all employees right so who is that supervisor that supervisor is a server because he is actually providing services by leading the team by telling the team what to do by telling the team how to work by by providing information so so today you guys are working in office and if you want some information you are going to your supervisor and asking him if you want approval you're going to your supervisor and asking him so that is how server provides services so today we like i said we have email servers provides email services we have file server provide file services we have web server provide web services correct so we have different kind of servers that provides different kind of services and i already did show you this is like a server room and inside server room we have switches we have routers we have servers and so on correct this is explanation so basically you can note it down whenever you see the video server can also be called a responder responder so today when you have a problem when you want to access something you will do what you will access it through the server so if i come here and i type google.com what happened i am accessing google how i am accessing google i am accessing it through the google server and google server is responding to my requests that is why server is called a responder server is a powerful computer running with server operating system i have already explained that to you and responding to requests made by clients who are the clients they are the clients you are the client anyone who is requesting is called a client let me ask you a question can server be a client can server be a client yes because if this is a server and this server wants to access a web page or send an email it can become a client to access the other server at the same time it can be a responder and requester at the same time it can be a responder and requester server provides various functionalities called such as file sharing email print and much more right a quick overview of history so if you click on this link this link will basically take you uh to uh the different versions and history windows 10 windows 8.1 windows 8 7 vista xp me 95 windows nt so you see windows 1.0 it was made on november 20 1985 and it was unsupported on december 30th 2001. so basically you see all different end users operating system with when it was released their different additions and support status same thing for servers you see if i go down we have windows nt 3.1 3.5 windows server 2003 r2 you see it is also showing me the start menu for it i don't know if most of you remember but you see that's how that's how windows 3.1 was you see it it was like a folder that's how it was if i click on it it will actually show you all the details about it so i recommend you all go through this and just you don't have to memorize but look into it so you know what operating systems we had before and their release date and so on it's very interesting so that that is one thing um so that that is what the server is correct the next question that comes into mind is how do i buy a perfect hardware for my server let's just say that you have started in a new company right today is your new uh today is your first day in your job and your manager comes in and says that i need a recommendation from you for a file server and he said that he will install server 2019 so how are you going to purchase a server now so let's just say i come to you and say hey kawa or enam or omede or zia you know what um i want to buy a file server can you please tell me what hardware is good and do us some do some research for me how are you going to do it now let's see it the very first thing whenever you are buying something let me bring up this website for you whenever you are buying a server building versus buying so how to do it the very first question that you will ask yourself is what what operating system i will install right what is going to be the um role of the server right is it file server is it email server is it database server what is this server going to do and am i going to install applications in this server what is my budget very important question what is your budget how much money do you have to buy a server now what i will do is your manager said that we want to install server 2019 and it is a file server this thing is unknown we don't know what is your budget your budget is two thousand seven hundred dollars correct let's go and find a server now before i go and find the server i will first go to google and say server 2019 system requirement all operating systems have a system requirement server 2019 requires or like recommends or proposed processor cores 16 gb ram 128 gb um you can say for os for operating system and then for data for your data for example your files 512 gb and then 1gb nic card or network card there is our simple requirement now we have our requirement what i will do is i will come back here and say here is the answer so now i have my requirements my manager told me or this lab told me use dell or hp right now if we want to buy a dell server what you will do is you will simply come to google and type come to browser and type dell.com once you are in dell you see you click on products you can buy laptops you can buy desktops you can come here and you have this option called servers and storage there you go what do you need server storage networking or hyper converge infrastructure so so we need servers so we will focus here in here you see shop all servers tower rack rack servers are servers that you install in rack so so let's click here we want to know the prices here you go so it starts from 4.99 but it has two processors um this is five five to 559 and one processor two processor so so what kind of um what kind of um server we are looking for let's let's go with this one let's go with this one so r240 1u um r715 these are different models okay so these are different models if i click on the first one you can see that how many processors we need for see four processors and uh once we click there let me go back because it actually changed it okay so it is changing it um let me come here so okay so if i come here you can see i have r240 now if i click on build and price so this is the basic price okay this is the starting price starting price but if i want to add more configurations to it i can actually come in here and i can click on customize so what are the default options you can see currently it have 8 gb ram one terabyte hardware one year warranty if i click on customize and buy you can see now i can actually change it to different options okay so you can see i want how many cores i want four cores right okay so you see four c four core i have four c here core i3 so i will click here and then what i will do is i will actually go into memory so memory is currently 18 um i will add more so basically how many do i need um let me go back uh 16 gb so two is enough eight eight eight plus eight is sixteen or i can choose this two so 16 gb and then uh currently we also want to add some hard drive so currently it has one terabyte so one terabyte is enough because that's that's a lot but if you want to add more you can also add more so you see you can even add 12 terabyte it's a lot operating system you can also add operating system currently no operating system but if you add you will have to pay more you see windows server 2019 is how much 766 standard edition essential edition we will learn about editions in details so if i click on here you can see that now i actually have it as 967 it's not bad let's let's see uh the networking now so if i go up and try to find the networking memory processor everything is there so rate hard drive operating system then in here let's see power supply right now you see power supply single cable power supply 250 so what you can do is you can actually add more power supplies if you would like to just to provide redundancy so if one power supply goes down you you have another power supply working so this is how you can actually uh do the calculation once you're done you add it to the cart and then simply pay for it and then if you click on product detail it will basically give you more information about the server like the details about the server and how can you use it and everything else if you click on reviews it will show you all the reviews about it driver manuals and support if you want to download drivers you can click on there so that's how you can basically find a server same thing with the hp site so hp is another company right if you guys have laptop right now at home you it's either most of the time it's either hp or it's uh dell right so hp they also have servers so if i click here you can see um i basically have um shop pcs and then i have like different options here which i can click um and then i can click on different um up servers that i may have here let me check okay hp.com business laptops business desktops monitor scanner okay let me quickly check why i am not able to see it peace okay so so this is the website uh for server hpe i don't know me they have may have changed some settings but i'm not able to see but same thing you can do here like you can come and you can choose what server you want and you can customize it and and basically choose what what operating system you need and so on so but the main point in here was that before you buy a server always make sure what operating system you will install what is the requirement for operating system what rules are you going to install and what is the requirement"

        "Video Name": "you NEED to learn Windows RIGHT NOW!!",
        "Video ID": "X1CM3rZwGn8",
        "Video Transcript": "You need to learn Windows right now. No,\nyou really do. And let me tell you why. Microsoft Windows is everywhere. It\nhas over 75% of the desktop market, meaning out of all the desktop OS is out\nthere, 75% are using Microsoft Windows. And that's a lot of people\nand a lot of businesses. And that's the biggest thing I wanna\nfocus on. Why does that matter? Why? Why do you care? Jobs\nif you want a job in it, knowing Windows from the admin\nsupport perspective, it's required. Especially if you're just starting out\ntrying to get that first job in it. Usually help desk and think about it. It just makes sense if\nmost companies use Windows, most companies need people like you\nwith Windows skills. And by the way, I'm not just talking about, oh,\nI've launched Command Pro before. I mean actually knowing Windows, how\nto support it, administer it, fix it, break it. And speaking of\nbreaking, that's another thing. If you wanna become a\nhacker, ethically, of course, how can you not learn windows? Most of the time it's gonna be the thing\nthat you're hacking and you can't hack it if you don't know it, you can't\nhack it. Like seriously took this up. I'm going for this new\nhacking certification from\nHack the Box called the CPTs so I can become less of a hacking new\nand look at the prerequisites windows. So you gotta know Windows. And in this video I'm going\nto introduce you to Windows. And you may think you already\nknow Windows, you don't. There's a big world of Windows\nthat you haven't even thought of. And that's what we're covering in this\nvideo. It's more than just a desktop. You play games on or run Excel.\nI don't know what users do. And then I'll also show you\nwhat it means to know Windows, the difference between having user\nknowledge and having admin knowledge, which is the knowledge you'll get paid\nfor by companies. That's what you want, right? I'll also show you how you can start\nbuilding out your own Windows lab because you gotta have that. If you\nwanna learn something in it, you have to play with\nit. You have to break it. And even if you're a Mac and Linux user, I'm gonna show you how to get\naccess to this. And finally, if I convince you to learn Windows\nand you wanna learn it as a skill, I'm gonna show you some resources, courses and certifications that you\ncan take that will teach you Windows. And by the way, I'm creating a little Windows Fundamentals\ncourse right now that you can check out, lean Below. But I'll talk\nmore about that here in a bit. Now we're gonna cover a\nlot. So before we do that, let's take a quick coffee break and talk\nabout something a little controversial. Kind of the elephant in the room.\nWindows is really insecure, right? Like people who are using Windows\nare always getting hacked. Yes, I'll give you that. Windows\npeople are always getting hacked, but it's not because Windows is\ninsecure, it's because it's popular. If you're a hacker writing malware,\nyou're gonna write malware for the masses. So as a Windows user, what can you do to protect the most\ntargeted OS in the world? Use nor vpn, the sponsor of this video. Now\nI know what you're thinking. Why  doesn't make any sense,\nnor VPN is just a nor vpn, right? How's it gonna protect me against malware\nand phishing attacks and all these nasty things coming out? My Windows\npc, it's just a vpn, right? No, actually not. If you haven't\nlooked at norv PN in a while, it's got a few new tricks\nof its sleeve. For example, they've got threat protection now. So\nin addition to being the fastest VPN, that'll hide your IP address,\ngiving you a bunch of cool features, you can now go into your Nora VPN app, click on that little shield there and\nturn on web and file protection with just one click or two clicks\nof turning on with that. You're getting malware protection. You try to go to malicious websites\nand it won't let you do it. It protects you from you. Like seriously, if you try to download an infected\nfile with file protection that says no, don't do that. It's also gonna help out\nwith blocking trackers, blocking ads. It's kinda like having ads guard\nor pie hole with you all the time. And a URL trimmer, essentially\ngetting rid of your L tracking. Now what's cool about threat protection\nis that it's on all the time. Even when you're not connected to vpn,\nit's got your back on cyber threats 24 7. Now, beyond threat protection nor VPN does\nsomething I don't see anyone else doing and it's kind of cool. Check this\nout. Right now on my network, I configured my firewall to block\nVPN connections. Check it out. I'll try to connect to a US vpn and it's\njust gonna sit here and try to connect because my firewall can recognize\nVPN traffic and go, no Uhuh, you're not getting through. So I wanna\nstop that. It's not gonna happen. But no VPN now has obfuscated\n a very fun word, servers right here. Watch what happens when I try to\nconnect with one of those new servers. Click go into Florida, my neck and\nconnected. Now why did that work? Because my firewall couldn't recognize it. It obfuscated or bewildered \nmy firewall to where it couldn't recognize the VPN traffic. Super cool.\nSuper handy. If you wanna try it, check it out. Norv vpn.com/network.\nChuck, I got a link below. Seriously, if you don't have a VPN or you\ndon't like the one you're using, or if you do like the one you're using,\nswitch anyway.  use nor V vpn, support the channel. Check it\nout, link below. Seriously, thank you to norv VPN for sponsoring\nthis video and making things like this possible. Here we go. Part one, let\nme show you just how big Windows is. Stuff you can't even fathom. But first,\nwindows a history as fast as possible. In fact, can I do it in 60\nseconds? Editor? Give me 60\nseconds somewhere. Ready? Let's go. Windows was born in 1985. It was a gooey or graphical interface\nfor Ms. Dos. Couldn't do much. The most fun was the clock program.\nIn 1990, something amazing happened. My wife was born also Windows 3.0. This thing was revolutionary\nsoftware and file icons. It looks dumb and slow right now, but this was groundbreaking and also\nkind of fun. You gotta try this. I've got a link below. You\ncan do it for free. , look at control panel . It's\namazing. It gave us virtual memory, Minesweeper and solitaire. I was\nalways terrible at solitaire. Not long after that was Windows 3.1,\nwhich gave us Windows Media player. This is seriously pretty\nfun. You have to try this. This one I had to build out myself in\nvirtual box. In 1995, we had Windows 95. Let's start it up. , you hear that Windows 95 kind of feels\nlike home. It gave us our task bar, our start button. This was\nmy first computer OS in\n1998. We have Windows at 98. Oh man, this brings back the memories and it\nseems much like Bill Gates demo of Windows 98. Mine is failing. Look\nat us, me and Bill. You'll. Notice that this scanner bill, whoa. But it gave us improved USB support,\nmultiple monitors, which is kind of huge. They were actually really big like the\none behind me back there and it just looked prettier. I wish I could look\nat it right now. Then things got weird. We got Windows Me or Millennium\nEdition came out in the year 2000. It was terrible, but it did\ncome with automatic updates, restore and Windows movie maker, which\nis where I made my first YouTube video. Fun fact, it was the original\nCinnamon Challenge . And it's the reason I'm doing what I\nam doing today. But it wasn't all lost. Windows 2000 came out in the year\n2000. This is actually pretty good. It had a server version of the same\nname and it brought in Active directory, which is what we still use today.\nThen we brought out the Big Guns 2001, my favorite Windows OS of all time\nWindows xp. Let's start this Bad boy up. Oh my gosh, look at this. Oh, people use this OS forever. In fact, it was the first OS I\nsupported on the help desk. I had to migrate people off of XP to\nWindows seven. This thing was amazing. It was stable, it brought\nin remote desktop. It was a beautiful os mainly\nbecause it had pinball. I know my timer's out, I don't care,\nI'm just gonna play pinball. 2006, we had Windows Vista and no one\nliked it. I thought it was okay. I had a good time. But it\nbrought in Windows search, windows Defender and user account\ncontrol, all which we use today. 2009, brought in Windows seven, the only\ngood replacement for Windows xp. It was beautiful, had great\nperformance security, it was great. And then we had Windows\neight, which wasn't 2012. They tried to build it\nfor touch applications. Everyone hated and they took away our\nstart bar. Don't take my start bar, but then they brought it back in\nWindows 8.1, but we were so burnt by it. No one , no one did it. They got smart and they released\nWindows 10 in 2015, which was amazing. We just left that version. It brought\nus Cortana, which we don't use, and the edge browser, which is\nactually pretty cool now. And finally, we're at Windows 11. Windows 11\ngave us a better virtual desktop. So we can do stuff like this. Let's\nhow you do it. Hold on. Oh yeah. This old guy over here, right?\nNo. Oh, it's this guy . Why couldn't I find that? Yeah, create\na new desktop. Kind of neat. Again, I don't use it  ever. And\nwe got, you know, widgets I think. And the apps look different\nin our start menu, but you can't really call a start menu.\nI mainly just do Windows Key. Okay, I'm I'm rambling. Things look visually\ndifferent. They perform better. That's what we're using now. That was\nWindows history in exactly 60 seconds. I did it right? Yes, but what if\nI told you that's not everything. There's another world of Windows\nthat you don't even know about. They were released around the\nsame time of each edition. They're hiding in the background.\nI'm talking about Windows servers. I'm not gonna go over everything, but here's a list of all of\nthem released over the years, starting with Windows NT 3.1 in\n1993 and now we're at Windows Server 2022. Notice they have a yearly naming\nscheme now starting in Windows 2000. But that's the first big thing I\nwant you to know about Windows. They probably didn't know there are\nservers, windows servers. But why? Like what is that for? Because as a user, you're probably just familiar with\nWindows 10, windows 11 using the desktop, using the laptop, gaming. What's the\nserver do? Let's talk about that. A server provides services. So like\nright now you're watching me on YouTube, right? This service is being provided\nby a web server somewhere. In fact, everything you visit on the internet\nis a server providing you a service. So when we're talking about Windows\nserver, what is it providing services to? Well, in a company you might be running Windows\nServer 2022 in your data center and then deployed out to all your employees\nwill be Windows 11 on their desktops, on their laptops or whatever it is. And the Windows server is doing some\npretty cool stuff like centrally managing user accounts through a little tool\nwe like to call active directory. Active directories huge. It's a skill you have to learn\nand think about what it does. Instead of an admin having to go to each\nmachine and creating a user account for each user, which would be tedious,\ntime consuming and frankly maddening. I'm kind of going crazy just\nwriting this out multiple times. Can you imagine actually creating it?\nOh my gosh. Instead of doing that, I've got a server spun up right here. You would launch a doc or active director\nusers and computers and create a new user, Bernard Hack. Well by\nthe way, on the help desk, you'll probably end up doing this a\nlot. So if you already know this skill, if you can say, yeah, I've done that\nbefore. I've got my own lab at home, I've got this running,\nthat's pretty killer. Let's go to finish creating this user. And what's crazy is that\nuser I just created, he can log in to any of the\ncomputers at my company. Doesn't matter where he\ngoes, he tries to log in. The server running Active directory\nwill handle the authentication. The server will also act as\ncentralized storage, creating shares, network shares through the\nfile and storage service.\nCreate a new one right now. This creates a network folder that can\nbe accessed by anyone given permission using the SMB protocol, which you'll\nlearn a lot about if you study Windows. And then this thing will blow your mind. Windows servers have a\nthing called group policy, which allow them to control everything\nabout all the workstations in the company, everything down to\nthe smallest little thing. And actually check this out, if\nyou're running Windows right now, you can try this. Every Windows computer has what's called\nlocal group policy and you can do crazy things. Try this, we're gonna\nopen it up. So hit your start bar, search for group policy. And you have the option to edit\ngroup policy or you may not, you may not have permission. Someone blocked you with group policy and\nyou can do things like, lemme find it. Preventing access to command prompt.\nEnable it apply. Okay, try to launch it. It's been disabled. I always\nhated that when it happened to me. Or you can disable removable USB drives. So if someone had a flipper zero and\nthey were trying to use the bad USB function, you try to plug\nit into your computer, but you would change this setting. Deny a read access enabled bad\nUSBs, can't hurt you. Sorry, I was gonna drop that .\nLet's put a back tape in his drawer. Now just take a moment and appreciate how\nmany things you're able to change here that aren't just available in the regular\nmenu like control panel and stuff. And then think about how\nyou can do this on a server. Just one little change in\ngroup policy on the server. And you can apply this to computers,\nyou can apply it to users. It's insanely powerful, insanely fun. I used to love deploying\nthings through group policy. It's also kind of dangerous.\nYou gotta be careful. Don't just go crazy with it If\nyou have access, and by the way, there's nothing stopping you from\nsetting up your Windows computers in your house with a window\nserver controlling them. I actually do that right\nnow for my daughters. I control everything they do on\ntheir computers with group policy. It's awesome and needed. You know\nwhat I mean? If you have or sons, I mean kids are crazy. No, I'm just scratching the\nsurface on what servers can do. It takes an entire course just to talk\nabout it. An entire certification. We'll cover that here in a moment. But what's crazy is in talking about\nthe big world of Windows that you don't know, I haven't even talked I\nabout the cloud, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft is all about the cloud.\nThey're pushing everyone to it. Now what's the cloud? It's\njust someone else's computer. Instead of having a server here in my\ncloset here, I do have a server room. Instead of putting it here, I would put it in Microsoft's data\ncenter and they would run it for me. And everything I've talked about\nregarding servers can be done in Microsoft Azure and kind of at a crazy\nscale and it can do a lot more. I mention active directory. Well\nwe have Azure Active Directory. You can deploy virtual machines, which\nare Windows machines up in the cloud. I'll actually show you how\nto do that here in a moment. People run their entire\ncompanies in the cloud. They even have their users accessing\nremote desktops that are running in Azure. So instead of like logging\ninto a computer at their desk, they log into a computer at their\ndesk that actually is somewhere else. It doesn't make any sense. It's really\ncool, but it's actually, it's amazing. It does make total sense if you study\nit and learn it, which you should. The cloud, Microsoft Azure, that's\na skillset that you should learn. And when you do learn it,\nwell that's big money. That's the skill companies will pay for. I'll cover how you can learn that here\nin a bit. Now speaking of the cloud, let's talk about how you can get access\nto Windows and build your own lab. And I don't care if you already\nhave a Windows machine right now. I mean you can play with Windows\non your current machine, but I, if you're like me, you tend\nto play too much and break it. So if you want to avoid\nbreaking your own stuff, it's helpful to build out another Windows\nmachine that you can feel good about breaking and then just destroy it, build\nit up again, which you can totally do. Now to build your own Windows lab,\nyou do have a number of options. I'm gonna show you two right now.\nOne you probably already saw coming. Build Your lab in Microsoft Azure. I love this option because it kind\nof gives you the best of everything. Not only are you building\na lab to learn windows, but in the process of building that\nlab, you're learning Microsoft Azure. That is huge. Are you kidding me? And anyone can do it and starting\nout it'll be completely free. So to set up a Microsoft Azure account\nmean there is one kicker that people are gonna be like, oh Chuck, you\nsaid it was free. This is stupid. Why  Chill with me here? It does require you having a\ncredit card when you get signed up. They do that for a couple reasons.\nWell really one main reason. They wanna make sure you're an actual\nperson and that's how they verify you're a person. But they won't charge you\nfor anything unless you say yes, I want to be charged this amount of money. So you'll set up a free tier account\nand right off the bat you'll get a $200 credit for the first 30\ndays to do a lot of stuff. And let me give you an example. So I did go out to Google and\nI searched for Microsoft Azure. You should do this right now. You'll see here the option to set up a\nfree account and you can start free with the $200 credit as promised. And they have a lot of services\nthat are free all the time. So if you wanna try this, by all\nmeans do it. And once you have it, check this out. This\nis Bernard Hack Well's, a free Azure account right\nnow he's on the free tier. I have a Windows server\nand Windows 11 running. In fact that server I was showing you\nearlier, running in Azure for free, that Windows 11 machine\nalso running in Azure. I've been running these off and on for\na few days and it's only charged me $3 and 64 cents of my $200 free credit. Now, even after your free credit, running stuff in the cloud can be really\nfun as a lab because they only charge you for what you use. It's\npay as you go. So for example, using their pricing calculator, I'm pricing out a Windows 11 machine with\nthis particular sizing because it does matter how big your machine\nis, how much RAM and cpu. This will cost me about 12 cents\nan hour as you can see here. And it's only gonna charge me that\nwhile it's running. If I shut it down, I'm not being charged\nfor it. So imagine this, you set up a Windows lab in Azure. Let's\nsay it's four machines, couple servers, couple windows, VMs, let's say 12 cents\nan hour. And you study for an hour. What's that? 48 cents, 50\ncents, let's call it 50 cents. It costs you 50 cents\nthat data to your lab. I think it's a pretty cool way to\ndo it. Probably my favorite way. And I always use Azure when I'm deploying\nWindows stuff and playing with it. It's my go-to. And while I got you here, lemme show you how easy it is to\ncreate a virtual machine in Azure. So once you do have your account set\nup, you might be kinda like, oh Chuck, where do I go? Cuz it can be kind of a\nlot . Large companies use this. Enterprises use this to run their entire\ncompany. But once you're in Azure, you can click on the little menu icon\non the left and click on create a resource. You'll search for\nwhat you wanna create for you. It might be Windows 11, just hit enter.\nAnd if you're using the free tier, you'll want to use the Windows 11 preview, which is just an advanced version of\nWindows, previewing the newest stuff. Create that. There's just a few things\nyou have to change, like the name of it, if you scroll down a bit, you\ncan change the size of it. This'll change how much\nyou'll be charged per month. This one actually is\na pretty good machine. Put in your username and and password\none you wanna create right now. Check this licensing box. And then\nthere's one thing I always change, just really one more thing I'll go\nover to uh, I'll scroll to the top. Click on monitoring. I will under\nboot diagnostics, click disable. And that's pretty much it. We'll\nclick on review and create. It's gonna make sure everything's\ngood to go. Validation has passed. And then we'll click on create\nand just give it a minute. Take a little coffee break. I mean it is building an entire\ncomputer for you in the cloud. So give us some time.\nNow while that's cooking, I do wanna show you one thing\nto give you some peace of mind. Many of you may be worried, okay am\nI'm gonna be charged a ton of money. I've heard horror stories about the\ncloud making people go bankrupt. No, that's not gonna happen to you. And let me show you how\nyou can make sure of that. We're gonna go to the left here, top\nleft and display all our services stuff. At the bottom left we have cost management\nand billing. Click on that here. It shows you everything that's going on. It'll show you your free credits and\nhow much stuff you have remaining. It'll show you what you have to due. So\nfor now, if you're using the free tier, you'll have nothing due. And again, once the free tier is over that 30\ndays and you do have services still up, they're not gonna charge you for those\nservices. They're gonna say, Hey, um, you still have stuff up. Do you wanna\nstart a pay as you go subscription? And you can say yes or no.\nAnd if you don't do anything, they're just gonna shut\nit down. No big deal. Now let's say you do start\nyour subscription and you're\nworried that you might be overcharged or forget a virtual\nmachine was up or something. You can fix that real easy. You can go to cost alerts over here on\nthe left and we can add a new budget. I'll name it, I don't\nwant to go broke, please. And we can set a monthly budget,\nlike maybe it's 20 bucks. And when we hit an actual budget of 50%, send me an alert to this email. Now let's go look at our virtual\nmachine and try to access it real quick. Let's go to our menu. We'll\ngo to resource groups. A resource group is kinda like a\nfolder containing a bunch of resources. And when you created a virtual\nmachine, you created one as well. Here I have my Windows 11 machine\ngroup that was created for me. And inside that I've got a few resources. Mainly my Windows 11 machine right\nhere with a little computer icon. I click on him, he's launched, ready\nto go. If I wanna connect to him, I got a little connect button up here\nat the top left. Click on connect, we're gonna connect via R dp and then\nwe'll download the R DP file right here. Notice that downloaded a file here\non Windows. I'll just click it, click on connect, enter the account information I\nconfigured when I first set it up. And just like that, , I have a Windows machine in the\ncloud that I can log into, mess with, break destroy whatever anytime I want.\nAnd you can access this from anywhere, from any device, even your phone\nusing remote desktop. It's very easy. But if you'd like me to walk you\nthrough it, I've got it in my course. Now if you wanna stop your virtual\nmachine and stop being charged for it, we can go to overview and\nsimply click on stop. Yep, I wanna stop it and it'll stop your\nvirtual machine. If you wanna delete it, remove it. The best way to do that most of the time\nis to delete the entire resource group that the virtual machine is part of. So if I go back to my resource groups\nand click on my 11 machine group, I can click on delete resource group. It'll ask you to confirm\nby typing the name in, so my Win 11 machine underscore group and then delete everything in there. Cause\nyou'd have a network security group, you've got a firewall group and and\na public ip. No, delete it again. Here we go. Delete. So it'll clean up\neverything for you. Now beyond Azure, you can also run everything local, setting up your own virtual\nmachines on your own computer. Now this option is also very, very fun, but only fun if you have enough\nresources. Now what do I mean by that? Well if you're not familiar\nwith virtual machines, first of all go watch my video.\nI detail everything about them. But just know when you're\nrunning a virtual machine, you're running another computer on\nyour computer you have right now. And much like inviting a\nnew person to live with you, you're gonna have to share resources\nwith that new person or with that new computer. And my question for you is, does your computer right now\nhave enough resources to spare? And what I mean is this, um, if you open\nup your task manager here in Windows, just go to your search bar, search\nfor task manager. There it is. And you'll see right here we have a\nlittle performance graph icon that we can click on. This will tell you how many resources\nyour computer is using right now. The main concern for virtual machines\nwill be memory and the amount of disc space you have. CPU is\ndefinitely a concern, but for most machines it's going\nto not really be a problem. Memory is a big one. Now if you can see from mine right now\nI have 64 gigs of memory and I'm only using 50% and that's running\nall my stuff right now. So I know I could probably create four\nor 5, 6, 7 virtual machines cause I have so much memory available to spare. If you're rocking a four gigabyte\nmemory laptop or something, you're in trouble buddy. I wouldn't\ndo anything with virtual machines. But if you have eight to 16,\nyou can probably run a few. And what that's gonna look like\nis downloading a hypervisor, a free one called Virtual Box and\nthen downloading a Windows 11 ISO or Windows Server 2022. You can get a free trial version\nand download any of these for free. Let me walk you through that\nreal quick. It's not too crazy. You can go to Google and simply\nsearch for download Windows 11. That'd be the first link in the search. And you can just download an ISO\nfor SI x 64 devices download now choose your language and then\nsimply click on download. Now I do wanna caution\nyou with this . You do wanna make sure that\nyou have an X 86 X 64 system. Most people do, unless you're running\nthe new MacBooks like M one, M two, apple silicon, this is\nnot gonna work for that. The new MacBooks are\nbuilt with arm processors, meaning you'll need an arm-based os. Now\nWindows 11 does have an ARM-based os, but it's kind of difficult to get access\nand find a good ISO to to use with virtual box. But there is a really\neasy way to do that with Parallels. Parallels is a hypervisor similar\nto Virtual Box but it's not free. But they make it super easy to download\nWindows 11. So if you wanna try it out, they do a free trout for 14 days and\nthe first thing they ask you to do is install Windows 11, which they\nmake it just, it's so stupid easy. I don't know why it's so\nhard for everyone else. But once you have your Windows 11 iso,\nyou'll want to go download Virtual Box. You'll just search for\nvirtual box and my Google, click on that first link and\ndownload it for whatever I'm using. If you have an Intel based Mac,\nit'll probably work for you. Windows host Linux distributions that got\nyour back download and install that to basic installation. If you run into any issues specific to\nvirtual machines and working with Virtual Box, check out my virtual machine video. I do demo and detail a few things that\nmight be a bit of a stumbling block for you. But once you have\nvirtual box up and running, you simply click on new type in\nwhat you wanna build. Windows 11, that's what I wanna name it.\nType in machine, select your iso, I would skip the unattended\ninstallation. Click on next Notice. It does default to four gigs of memory. That's the minimum required for Windows\n11, two virtual CPUs. That's fine, you can increase it if you\nwant 80 gigabytes of storage, it's not gonna pre allocate the\nentire thing Next, next finish. And all you gotta do is start that sucker\nup and install Windows 11 like it's a brand new laptop. It's kind of cool.\nAnd you do have to hit the key to say, I want a boot from the cd. I made that\nmistake earlier, I forgot to do it. And that process works for any server\nOS you wanna go with unless you're using Mac uh, in one processors. Cause you can get a free trial of\nany server OS right now for Windows. It's pretty amazing. Now, how can you\nlearn Windows in a structured way? I'm a big fan of this now you\ncan play with Windows all day, but if you wanna get serious, you'll want some kind of course\nor structured learning plan, like a certification to take you deeper\nin the things that you wouldn't even think about learning. There are two\noptions I wanna cover right now. Certifications and courses. Let's\nstart with certifications. Now, you know I love certifications. The first one I would recommend\nis the CompTIA A plus. Now there's good and bad with\nthis. The good is that, man, it covers so much in the certification.\nIf you want to become an IT person, if you wanna get started on the\nhelp desk, get your first job in it. The A plus is a great start.\nIt was my certification, but it covers everything\nfrom USBs to tablets to some Linux stuff. It'll have a section on Windows os and\nthe basics of what you need to know. It won't cover everything Windows. So even some of the stuff we covered in\nthis video they're not gonna talk about. That's gonna be very basic. But it is a great starting point and it\nwill look pretty good on your resume. It'll help you get a job. Now the other\noption is going Microsoft specific. Microsoft does have certifications. Let's go to Microsoft's certification\nplace and we'll talk about it. Now, I do love Microsoft certifications, like\nyou'll learn a ton going through them. My only beef with them is\nthat they change so much. And here's the problem with that.\nWhen you're getting a certification, one of the main considerations that\nyou want something that's marketable, so think ccna, compt A plus.\nIf you put that on your resume, you know when an HR person or a\nhiring manager sees that they, they know what it is and\nthey know what, you know, Microsoft kind of struggles with that. They used to have what's called the\nMCs A, which is very recognized. It was like similar to the ccna,\nbut then they did away with it. And I don't even know, like , I couldn't tell you off the top of my\nhead what the certifications are apart from the Azure ones, which are marketable.\nSo let's talk about that right now. First, let's go Windows specific.\nA brand new one that I really like, if you wanna learn Windows and Windows\ndesktop at a deeper level is the MD 1 0 2, the Microsoft 365 certified\nmodern desktop administrator associate. And I say modern because you're gonna\nbe learning about it from the 365 view, which is like their cloud\nversion of how to manage stuff. I'm not gonna go deep into that now,\nbut it does include Microsoft 365, some Azure, but also a lot of managing and deploying\nand fixing and supporting Microsoft Windows. Now again, I don't see a lot of people asking\nspecifically for this because no one knows about it. You're gonna be doing\nthis one for the knowledge, and if a hiring manager\ndoes happen to look at you, they like you and they ask you, Hey, what\nis this thing? You can tell them, Hey, latest and greatest, I know my\nstuff. Then they'll go, oh, okay. But it's getting past that initial HR\nscreen that this might give you a problem with. Now beyond this one, they have\nthe Microsoft certified Windows server, hybrid administrator associate,\na mouthful and a half. This one's more server focused.\nI would recommend if you, man, you're going hog wild with windows, go to the MD 1 0 2 first and\nthen jump and see this guy. Looks like it does take two exams\nto get land the certification, the AZ eight hundred and eight oh one, and they say hybrid because\nthey're talking about\non-prem and a data center and also in the cloud. Microsoft Azure. A lot of companies are living in\nboth worlds right now, hybrid. And then if you wanna go full on cloud, which I've gotten both of\nthese certifications, I'm\nabout to recommend to you. And I actually taught\ncourses on 'EM as well. These certifications are fantastic. We\nhave the beginner version, the AZ 900, Microsoft certified Azure Fundamentals.\nIf you're new to Cloud, perfect. If you're not new to cloud,\njump straight into the AZ 1 0 4, Azure Administrator Associate Landing. These two certifications\nmakes you crazy valuable. If you want to get started at Nit\nMan, having this will be solid. I have to say this, it will help to know a bit of Windows\nbefore you start these because these are very cloud focused. They're focusing\non deploying stuff and Microsoft Azure, but they're assuming you already\nknow how to deploy Windows and what servers are like. They're assuming a lot and\nthey're assuming you can\ntake that knowledge and then learn how to deploy that in the\ncloud. So as a prerequisite, I would say learn Windows, and that\nwas from the certification perspective, but I don't necessarily think you\nneed a certification to learn windows. Learning windows can be done in a course. A course that gives you enough to\nmove on to the more advanced things. That's part of the reason right now. I have a Windows Fundamentals\ncourse on my academy. It is currently in development and it'll\nprobably be finished by the time you see this, and you can look at it link\nbelow right now. But in that course, I give you enough to be dangerous with\nwindows and enough to step forward to the next things and not feel\nlike a fish outta water. So you could step forward into\nthe Azure world and not feel like, I don't know windows. You know,\nyou'll have enough skills. Or if you wanna become a hacker, you can learn enough windows\nin this course to move\nforward and be dangerous and start learning more advanced\nthings. It's fundamentals, it's giving you a good foundation. Other courses I love are\non Hack the Box Academy. They have a Windows Fundamentals course\nthat is mostly actually all text-based, so if you enjoy reading,\nyou'll have a good time. And they do have labs built into it,\nwhich is a really, honestly pretty killer. That's all I got. I'll\ncatch you guys next time."

        "Video Name": "40 Windows Commands you NEED to know (in 10 Minutes)",
        "Video ID": "Jfvg3CS1X3A",
        "Video Transcript": "Here are the top 40 Windows command\nprompt commands you need to know. And we're gonna do this\nin 10 minutes. So first, let's launch our Windows command prompt. Either hit Windows Key S or click the\nstart menu icon and search for cmd. Right? Click that and put that sucker in\na beast mode. Run as administrator. Here's our playground. Let's go.\nWhat's your computer's IP address? Make you find out with IP can fit. Bam.\nAll your IP information right there, but not everything. Where's your Mac\naddress? Where's your DNS server? For that we need IP config slash all.\nThis will give us all the goodies. Now that's way too much information. We gotta filter it and we\ncan do it with this command. Save command as before IP config slash\nAll this time we'll do a pipe and type in find STR R or find string and we'll\ntell it what we're looking for. Maybe we wanna see DNS and that's all\nwe wanna see and that's all we get. Love it. And by the way, you can use\nfine string on any command. It's awesome. Maybe your computer\nneeds a new IP address. We can do that with IP config and\nwe'll first do release to let it go. And then we'll type in renew reaching out\nto our DHCP server and getting a fresh new IP address. Keeping in mind that will refresh every\nsingle interface on your computer. If you don't wanna do that, then specify\nthe interface just after your command. Now DNS can be a problem. In fact, it's\nalways dns. It's never in the network. Remember that. So let's\ntroubleshoot DNS first. We'll see what your computer knows.\nIP config for slash display dns. Basically all the websites it\nknows about and their IP addresses. But when you're troubleshooting\ndns, that's kind of hard to read. It'd be great if we could just copy\nthat to our clipboard and look at it somewhere else we can with this command.\nThis command's awesome by the way. So same command as before, IP\nconfig four slash display dns. But right after that we'll do a\npipe and then simply type in clip. This command will copy the output of\nthat command to your clipboard so you can fire up your favorite notepad application\nand paste that sucker right in there. That's powerful. I love that. I'll\nnever ever forget to flush. And also, sometimes you might wanna flush your\nDNS IP config ford slash flush dns. This will delete your DNS\nresolver cash on your computer, removing any old stale DNS entries. Take\nthat dns. It's always your fault. Oh, and by the way, have you hacked\nthe YouTube algorithm today? Let's make sure you do hit that like\nbutton notification, bell comment, subscribe. You gotta hack YouTube\ntoday ethically, of course. Now to troubleshoot DNS even further,\nyou may want to use NS lookup. With NS lookup, we can do things\nlike, Hey, where is network chuck.com? What's his IP address? And it'll tell you what DNS server\nyou're using and what answer it gave you. If you wanna try another DNS\nserver real quick, you can do that. S look up never chuck.com.\nAnd they're right after. Specify that other DNS server, let's\nsay Google. And we got a second opinion. You can also check for other types of\nDNS records from MX to TXT to pointers. Trust me, you're gonna need those commands\ncuz it's always dns. It's always dns, always dns. Now look at your screen,\nit's messy. Go clean your screen. Don't be alop. And we can do that with\none command. C Ls. Clean your screen. Is that, what's it stand for? I don't\nknow. It cleans your screen. Do that. Hey, what's your Mac address?\nGive it to me right now. Sorry you were too slow but you wouldn't\nhave been if you used this command. Get mac slash v bam.\nThere it is right there. There all your Mac addresses. This command will see if you have any\nenergy or power issues with your computer power CFG slash energy. Give it a minute,\nit'll give you some awesome stuff, a great report on how you're\ndoing. Also, how's your battery? What power CFG slash battery report. It will report to you and what's going\non? Just copy that file location, paste it into your command prompt.\nBam, there it is. Battery report. It'll tell you if your battery sucks.\nMine's okay I think. I'm not sure. This next one is super handy. It's a SS\nooc, you thought I was done? Hit enter. And it's gonna show you which file types\nare associated with which programs. So for example, MP four files will\nopen with Windows media player, but honestly I prefer to use\nvlc. So with one command, actually with that same command, we can specify the file type and have\nthat equal the program you want to use. Bam. Now, hey, is your computer haunted?\nIs it going kind of slow? Does it suck? Don't throw it away just yet. Calm\ndown buddy. Let's check a few things. Let's make sure it's okay with a\ncommand. C H, K, Dsk check disk. It can check on a few things. Let's see if you need a\nrepair with the Ford slash f, it will actually go through your disc and\nsee if there's any errors and fix 'em. You may wanna try a dash r. This will actually check for\nphysical sector issues and fix 'em. Keeping in mind this might need a reboot,\na restart and it could take a bit, especially if your computer is\nactually haunted. Is it haunted? Now if that doesn't work\nand your computers still\nscaring the crap outta you, then try this one. S F C,\nthe system file checker. It'll check your system files\nincluding things like Windows, DL L files and replace them\nand fix them if they're bad. So do a forward slash scan\nnow to make magic happen. Now if your computer's really, really haunted and you're\nstill having some issues, you'll need this Command D SM deployment,\nimage servicing and management. It's a command line tool that will\nactually fix your system image. You'll wanna start with a quick checkup, check the health and maybe go a bit\ndeeper with a longer scan with the option scan health. And if it does\ncome up with some scary issues, let's go ahead and restore your health.\nMan, I wish our health was that easy. You know it actually\nis coffee, it doesn't. So after you've run the DSM commands, go ahead and go back and do\nthe SFC commands once more. SFC scan now and you should be good. And those commands should remove the\nhaunted ness of your computer. . It shouldn't be scary anymore and it'll\nprevent you from having to reinstall Windows. Now don't you hate it when someone\ntakes a bad USB and plugs it into your computer and Rick rolls you. To stop this, we'll need\ntwo things. First task list. We gotta find the task on our system,\nthe process that's doing something. Task list will list all of our tasks and\nusing the fine string thing we learned earlier, we'll find what we're looking\nfor. Search for script. There it is. Now taking that process id, I can then use Task\nKill to kill that task, Task kill for slash F to force it for\nslash P I D to specify the P I d and it's terminated. Now if you\nthought IP config was cool, meet his older brother Net sh much\nlike me and my younger brother Cameron, the older brother, is much cooler and more powerful\nand smarter and better in every way. Like this command right here,\nW Land Show, W Land Report, this will give you a super fancy\nwireless report about your wireless. So if we open that file by\ncopying that file right there, pacing it here heading enter a gorgeous\nreport on your wireless situation and look at that. It even has some commands\nin here. What the heck? That's cool. We could honestly spend all day\nwith an sh cuz he's so cool. By doing things like\ninterface, show interface, showing you your interfaces. We can do quick one liners to find\nour IP addresses. Bam, there they are. DNS servers. Bam, kind of there they\nare. Wasn't as easy as I thought. And even cooler and crazier as you can\nturn off the Windows Defender firewall with one command, BAM\nturned off. But don't worry, the big brother's always a good\nguy. He can turn it right back on. So if you wanna avoid that getting hacked, then check out the sponsor of this video\nBit Defender and their premium security bit. Defender keeps your computer safe even\nwhen Windows Defender can't like check this up on this computer running. But defender notice I can't make\nany changes to my firewall settings. It says it's being managed\nby Bit Defender Firewall. If I try to run that\nsame command at Shoji, which is the same command hackers\nwe'll use to disable things, let's try to turn it off. It tells\nme, okay, but it didn't do anything. Bit Defender has your back.\nThey even tell you, hey, you're safe and we all need\nsomeone to tell us we're safe. And it's not just firewall. If\nyou got online threat prevention, which will actually block online threats\nand they're constantly scanning your system for vulnerabilities and they do\nsome ransomware remediation in case you do get some ransomware when you fall\nfor that fishing attack, hey it happens. And they have your back with privacy too\nfrom a Safe Pay vpn, password managers, anti tracker, they actually block web trackers from\ntracking you on profiling you. And also, do you ever wonder if like your webcam\nis still on or someone's listening to you? Well you don't have to\nwonder about that anymore. Bit Defender will check that constantly\nand make sure it only turns on when you want it to turn on. Now I\nknow what you're thinking, Bit defender's gonna slow my computer\ndown. I want speed, I get that. And they get that too. So\nthey have different profiles\nfor when you're working, watching a movie playing game or you're\ndangerously surfing, public wifi, whatever the case, they'll adjust your\nsystem to help you do what you gotta do. And if you don't wanna worry about it,\nthey'll switch auto magically for you. So check the link below, you'll get Bit\nDefender Premium Security for 64 98. It's a whole year saving\nyou $95 off the full price. And you can use it on 10 devices from\niOS, Android, Mac, and especially Windows. You need it on Windows now is\nNetwork. chuck.coffee up right now. Let's find out. Let's ping\nnetwork. chuck.coffee. Cool, we're getting a response. Ping is what we can use to make\nsure servers and websites are up, but it only told us four times. What\nif we wanna sit there and watch it, just ping it over and over and over again. We can do that with ping dash t\na 10 us ping. It'll never stop. It'll keep going. Which is super helpful for when\nyou're just troubleshooting stuff. If you wanna see if the road to your\nfavorite website is a bit bumpy, try out Tracer Tracer, which is Windows dumb version\nof saying Trace Route. This will actually trace the path to your\nfavorite website along each router it takes to get there and tell you if that\nsuckers up or how long it's taking to go into that guy. Maybe that guy is\nslow, it'll tell you it can be slow. So to speed it up just a little bit, do tracer dash D to not resolve\ndomain names a little bit faster. Net stat is probably my\nfavorite thing on Windows. It'll tell you what's connected to\nyou and what you're connecting to. It'll also tell you what ports you\nhave open, which is kind of important. Netta dash afaf. Like right now I've got\nthese three popular ports. Open quiz, what are those four? Comment down below. And they're open on every single IP\naddress on my system. Every interface. And I'm listening, I'm\nwaiting for connections. Netta can also show you the process\nID for all your connections. The dash o switch. So if there is\nanything dangerous connecting to you, you can drop that P I d,\ndelete it with Task Hill. And you can also get some sweet sweet\nnet stats with thatta dash e dash T five giving you some sent receive\nstatistics every five seconds. This one is for the\nNetwork Geeks route print. This will show the routes your computer\nwill take to get to certain networks, what gateways it will use. It's the\nrouting table of your computer. So hey, here's your default route right\nhere. And with that same command, we can also add routes to\nour computer route add, allowing us to customize the way our\ncomputer reaches certain networks. So here I'm trying to get to the 1 92,\n1 68 40 network through this gateway. If I print the route again, there it is. And then with route delete it goes away. That's super handy when you're playing\nwith docker containers on a local VM and you wanna route to certain networks,\nit's, it's really cool. And then finally, my favorite command of all time. I\ncannot believe I didn't know about this. Shut down. Just like this.\nActually, no, not just like this. Obviously that command will\nshut down your computer, but with a few more switches\nand by a few I mean a lot. This will restart our computer\nand restart it into the system. Bios without you touching a dang thing.\nNo more spamming at 12, 11 at 10. No, just this command and it reboots into\nyour bio so you can change your memory profile so you can enable\nvirtualization. How cool is that? So thanks for watching. Thanks for having some coffee with\nme and I'll catch you guys next time. And don't forget to subscribe it and\ndo a lot stuff like, like the video."

        "Video ID": "prVHU1fLR20",
        "Video Transcript": "You thought you were done, but no. There are 35 more Windows commands\nyou need to know. Let's get right to, the first thing we'll do is launch our\ncommand prompt and B mode. Mr. B mode. So either hit Windows key S on your\nkeyboard or click the Windows icons as far from there. Type in cmd, right click\nand run as administrator. But hold up. What if it just ran as administrator\nby default all the time? Instead of clicking run as administrator,\nclick on open file location. There we have our command prompt\nshortcut. Go ahead and right click back. Click on properties advanced and click\non Run as administrator by default. Sucker click okay, apply. Okay, so now\nevery time you run command prompts, it will default to beast mode every time. This command will help you hide all your\ndeep dark secrets, the weird photos, the journal, everything.\nFirst, I'll take all my images and my\njournal and send them to a zip folder. And then with the copy command I can\nhide the zip file inside a photo of a kitten. Copy slash b, specify the image plus\nthe name of your folder, and then the name of your new secret\nphoto done to the random person. It's just a photo to you. It's a safe\nwith all your stuff. With this command, we can encrypt every file in that\nfolder so that no one can even open it. If they do find it. Cipher\nslash e and the folder, I'm in every file encrypted. So now only I can open these files and\nno one else can. This command is crazy. We can hide our folders from everyone\nlike this folder here with all my secrets. Keep an eye on it, it's gonna disappear. I'll type in a trip plus H plus S plus R, and the name of our folder, boom,\nit's gone. Even we can't see it. To bring it back, just do the opposite.\nChange your pluses to minuses, removing those attributes and the\ninvisibility cloak and there it is. Net sh w n Show profile. This command will show you every wifi\nnetwork you've ever connected to. And what's even crazier is you can see\nthe wifi passwords for every network right here in your terminal. Same\ncommand net SH WLAN Show profile. Specify the wireless network.\nI'll say see butterfly and then type in key equals clear to\nsee the wifi password in plain text. There it is right here. If you wanna see all wifi passwords for\neverything you have stored this crazy command, this one-liner will send you\nall of them. Now that's too much info, too much to parse through in a\ncommand prompt, what do you say? We put it into a file. Let's\ndo that same command once more, but at the very end we'll\ndo side arrow, side arrow, I think it's what they're called.\nAnd then the name of our file, wifi passwords dot txt and bam.\nAll right there in a file. Austin. Blur these please. Now you're never\ngonna remember that command ever. So let's say we put it into a batch\nfile for safekeeping open notepad. I'll paste in this command and\nthese will all be below by the way, file save as all files and\nwe'll call it wifi dot bat. Now we just type in wifi\ndot bat and there they are. This is a quick way to find out\nall the info on your system. You simply type in system info like this and it shows\nyou your system info. S, P or secure copy lets you copy a file to\na remote server securely type in s sep the file you want to copy and then the\nusername and the server you want copy to mine will be route at the IP address, then colon and where you want to\nstore it on that server. Hit enter, authenticate with your password\nand bam, that file is copied. I use this all the time now I\nbet you didn't know this one. Check this out right from Explorer,\nwherever I am, well say and Call of Duty. I can go up to the address bar, type\nin CMD, and suddenly a terminal, a command prompt and Call of Duty\njust like that. That's awesome. I can also do it in reverse where I'm\nat right now in the command prompt. I'll type in explorer and then dot right after that\nexplorer window open right where I am. That's awesome. Did you know you can map any folder\non your system as a mounted tribes? For real, check this out. The command will be S U B S T subs and\nthen a drive letter. Let's say S for, do you want some more coffee? Don't put a colon after that.\nAnd then the location, let's just use the one we have right here. I'll put that inside quotations and\nI think it did it. Let's go check. Let's open up explorer and yeah, there\nit is. Drive S. If I click on that, it goes right to the call of duty folder\nlike I mapped it. That's so weird. It'll probably want to undo that. So the command is subs slash\nd and then the drive letter, which was oh S for some more coffee. Okay, time for a quick coffee break and this\ncoffee break and the entire video is sponsored by IT pro tv, which\nis now it pro from ACI learning. Now you're gonna need them because\nof what I'm showing you here is just scratching the surface on it. If you wanna get a job and\nchange your stink and life, they've got all the training you need to\nstart learning and growing. So I don't care if you're just getting started\nor you're a seasoned veteran, there are always things\nyou have to learn cuz hey, we're in it and things\nare constantly changing. So whether it's that first cert or\nyou finally wanna learn hacking, they've got your back. And\nI'm scared to say this, but you probably don't even need\ncoffee. No, what am I saying? Of course you need coffee, but if you don't drink coffee you\nmay not need it because they're so entertaining they won't put\nyou to sleep. Like seriously, if you hang out with my friends\nlike Daniel Lowry and Ronnie Wong, you're gonna have a good time.\nSo ccna a plus cloud stuff, ethical hacking that got everything\nand when you're done watching, you can actually just start doing. They've got labs baked in and practice\nexams that'll help prepare you for exams. Let's probably self-explanatory,\nso if you wanna learn it like me, check out it pro TV like below.\nAnd if you use my code network, Chuck, you get 30% off forever.\nSo just just do it. It's cool. Coffee break over now it's\ntime to make your command prompt. Pretty first command is color. Type in\ncolor and just pick some random numbers. Like two and four. What? No, I can't,\nI can't see anything. Zero one. Well that's kind of nice. Four,\ntwo. Okay. Okay, so , let me uh get some help here.\nColor slash question mark. Ah, so here's the colors. Let's\nget it back. Seven, zero, nope. Opposite zero seven. Actually I\nwanna change it for the entire video. Let's go green on black old\nschool. So two will be green. That's the text black\nzero the background. Nope, I had it wrong. There we go. I spent\nway too long in this command . The first number is the background, second number is the text. Now we can do\nmore to make this thing pretty like we can change this. Check it out,\ntype in prompt bracket. Hey, beautiful closing bracket and\nthen dollar sign, capital G. Now that's how you have\na prompt right there. Now you didn't need the brackets but\nI thought it was prettier since we're talking about pretty, you could do it\njust like this, but that's not as pretty. Now if this is not your thing, just simply\ntype in prompts and it will reset it. Now if you wanna be even more\nextra, cuz you do and I do too, you can change the title\nof your window as well. For some reason it's all for prettiness. So just type in title and then what\nyou wanna title it home. Sweet Home, look at that. It changed the name.\nThat's nice. How much can you curl? This next section is crazy. You ready\nfor this? Modern windows like Windows 11, I think 10 has curl built\nin. Curl is amazing. So with the curl command we can do\nthings like, hey, what's the weather? We can check the weather in our command.\nPrompt curl w ttr, dash i n slash, where are you? I'm in Dallas. The weather\nright there in your command prompt. This is the coolest way to\ncheck the weather. Hands down, this one's pretty cool. You can\nactually unor shorten links, see where it goes before you open it, type in curl and a few parameters\nlike head and location. And then these shorten your url, just\npaste it in there and we'll get some info. And then, because we only care about\nthe location of it, where it's going, we'll do a bracket, type in fine\nstring and type in location. Bam, shorten link goes here. And also you\nshould go there and check it out. It pro tv. Shameless plug. You can also check these status\nof a website to see if it's up. Type in curl dash capital I then\nlowercase s and the website networks chuck.com. Is it up right now? Sure.\nHope so. Yeah, it is 200. Okay, which also happens to be the name of\nthe coffee I'm drinking right now. Wow. Oh my goodness. Where do I buy. Some Curl Continues. What's\nyour public IP address? Find out right from the\ncommand line Curl check IP amazon aws.com. Bam. Public\nip, but you can't see mine. I've blurred it out, right? Austin,\nyou blurred that, right? Thank you. This one's kind of dumb\nbut it's still pretty cool. You can use Curl from your command prompt\nto create a QR code type in Curl and then QR, e n c o.de, and then slash the\nwebsite. You wanna make a QR code for? Let's do network chuck.coffee\nand  QR code right here in your command prompt.\nThat's just the coolest way to do it. Let's see if it works. Dude, it totally\nworked. That's awesome. You're welcome. Now I have good news. You no longer have to rely on YouTube\nto know when I upload a video. You can use the command prompt.\nIt does everything fact curl, you can curl dash s and then this address, which is kind of long and at the end just\nsay user equals whoever you wanna see, and it will show you the latest\nvideo from your favorite YouTuber, at least the name of it. , not\nthe entire video. That'd be kind of cool. And you can even do it for Twitter.\nCheck this out. Same story, curl dash s, but a Twitter U url. And\nthere's my latest tweet. You never ever have to leave the command\nline. That's the point of this video. Stay here. I told you it's home.\nSweet home buddy. No curls not done. A few more you can define a word\ndictionary right in command, prompt curl dick.org/d for definition colon, and then a word. Let's\ndo the word of the day. Contra tense. An unexpected and untoward accident.\nSomething inopportune or embarrassing, A hitch . Use it in a word\nin this unhappy contra tenses. I'm never gonna use that word. Now this is probably the coolest use\nof Curl and it's where worlds collide. Twin Worlds. Collide. Now did you know you can\nuse chat G p t from the command line? This is crazy. Check this out.\nNow we're also still using Curl. I'm gonna paste in as long\ncommand. I'll have it below. Now let's ask it a question.\nWho has the longest beard? And there it is right there in\nthe command prompt. Eight feet, two and a half inches. How do you\nlive? Dude must know so much about it. Now we can use chat, G p, T\nand Windows command prompt. It's only fair that chat G P T can\nthen use command prompt on it, right? You can do that. By the way, found this\npost on Reddit with a pretty fun prompt. Let's try it out. Okay, we gotta set up. Let's see if\nit works. Yeah, I think so. Okay, well you can't curl or do anything else.\nBust it is stupid. Here's a fun one. You can open a website\nright from your terminal. Just type in start the website and\nit opens. With these two commands, you can delete all the temporary files\nto save some space if you're running outta space. So you can download that new\nCall of Duty update, run that command, and then run this command space restored.\nThis one's pretty dumb and pretty fun. You may not have this command. Type in\nTelenet and just see if you have it. Hit enter. Oh, you don't have it.\nLet's make sure you have it real quick. Hit Windows key S and just search for\nfeatures and click on that first option here. Turn Windows features on or off. We're going to enable Telenet a very old\nprotocol that's probably not safer to use for most things. Find Telenet,\nclick on it to enable it, click okay. It's gonna install it real quick. Done\nsuper fast. Now if you type in Telenet, it should work. How do I get out of\nhere? Oh, type in Q. Okay, type in Q, take me a minute, figure it\nout. Now time for the fun stuff. Type in Telenet and then\ntele hack.com. Ready? Go. Now pick your po, like maybe you wanna\nwatch Star Wars and your terminal. Why not type in Star Wars? And we're just gonna watch\nthis for the rest of the video. Ah, I'm got to this. Okay, that's\nenough. Let's get out of there. I had control C to stop it. Let's\ntry one more like Aquarium. Aquarium. I hear it. I mean that's just\nnice to have. Now time for the Fs. F1 through nine can actually make\nyou pretty awesome on your command. Prompt F1 will type in each\nletter from the last command. It's kinda strange. That's cool though.\nLet me try it again with a real command. Yeah, like I don't know what the use\ncase is for that. F two is even weirder. So like for example,\nif I type in IP config, that's the previous\ncommand I type in F two, it's gonna prompt me to copy the previous\ncommand up to a certain character. If I type in like I, it's just gonna\ncopy some of it. It's, I don't know, it's why common Blue If you\nhave a use case for that, I don't know. F three is more useful.\nIt'll copy the entire previous line. Okay, get that. F four\nis weird too. , I'll type in IP and think again and I\nhave to go to the beginning of the line. I'll type in F four and I'll say like, where do you wanna delete the character\nup to? Okay, let's delete it up to I. Okay, that's weird. I don't know. Again, I'm sure people like are amazing\nat this and find a great use case. I don't get it. F five is pretty cool.\nYou can cycle through previous commands. Just F five at, yeah, I like it. F six enters the EEO F or\nthe end of file indicator. That's handy for when you're hiding\nstuff. F seven is pretty cool. It opens up a list of previous commands. Now this is probably the coolest one here. I wanna do that one. Like that's\nawesome, right? Like, okay, that's, yep. F eight will like enter the very first\ncommand you typed in ever in this terminal or this command prompt,\nwhich apparently was cls. And then F nine is pretty weird.\nUm, it'll enter a previous command, but it'll prompt you for the number.\nSo like, I don't know, 24. Okay, that was the 24th command I entered in\nthis terminal. Again, weird use case. Now to get a proper list of\nall your commands printed out, you can do this dokey dokey slash history. Everything you ever did written\nright here. It's pretty cool. Now this next command is gonna break your\nbrain a little bit because what we're using right now, the command\nprompt, it's old news, it's stupid. I shouldn't even showed you this. The new kid on the block is\nterminal built into Windows 11. You can install on Windows 10. We're\ngonna close command prompt and now search for terminal. This thing's pretty slick. You can do everything we just did\nin Command Prompt, for example, we'll probably want an open command\nprompt cause the default into Power Shop. I'll cover that in a second. Click on the\nlittle tab here and do Command Prompt. But that's the killer feature,\nright? Tabs. Oh my gosh. So cool. Now because we're in terminal, it opens\nup some new features we can talk about. For example, maybe you're trying\nto use secure copy to copy a file, but you're like, man, what's\nthat file name? I don't want to, I don't know where it is.\nI don't wanna type it out. You can just open it and explore, find it, and just drag it there and it copies it. Could you imagine typing this\nout or trying to find it? That's awesome. Another cool thing is\nthat no matter where you are an explorer, you can shift, right? Click a\nfolder and say Open a terminal, and bam, there you are. If you need help,\njust simply ask for it. Type in help, and it'll give you pretty much\nevery command you could ever want. I think that's a lot of 'em. And typing in any of these\ncommands like subst or start, you can do a slash question\nmark to see how to use it. This command is not one at all.\nIt's this advice. Use this . Use PowerShell. PowerShell is better than Windows\nCommand for prompt in a lot of ways. Now, don't get me wrong, I still use\nCommand Prompt for a lot of things. It's just outta habit. It's\nwhat I've used my entire career. But if you wanna learn anything, you\nwanna dive deep. PowerShell is powerful. It's like command prompt but\nbetter. And you can do a lot more. And to use PowerShell, it's\nalready right here and terminal. You can switch back and forth between\nactually Azure Cloud Shell Command Prompt and Windows Power Shell. That's\nthe video. See you later."

        "Video Name": "how to HACK a password // Windows Edition",
        "Video ID": "L26Xq7m0uQ0",
        "Video Transcript": "In this video, I'm gonna hack Michael's\npassword on his Windows computer, and I'm gonna show you how it will\ninvolve grabbing his password hash and cracking it with tools from Callie Lennox. So we're gonna wait for\nhim to go to the bathroom. He normally lays his computer unlocked,\nwhich is really bad. Don't do that. So we're gonna wait and watch and then\nwe're gonna rush in there. All right, there he goes. Let's go to the bathroom.\nAll right, this is our window. Come on, come on, come on, let's go. I forgot\nabout coming. Okay. Okay, now we can hack. Almost built it. Wait, what now? Disclaimer, what I'm about to show you is a real\nhacking technique and should only be used ethically. Meaning you have explicit permission\nand you're following all the rules. And in this situation, I'm\nMichael's boss, so I make the rules. So right now I do have full access to\nMichael's desktop, but only for a moment. If I want to have it forever,\nI need to find his password. But there is one problem though.\nWindows doesn't just store his password. Plain text on the system.\nIt's stored inside a hash, like most modern systems\nin the applications that\nwhen you set up a password, they don't store that password\nthe way you see it like this. No, they don't do that. They take it and\nthey put it through a hashing algorithm. And in the case of Microsoft, it's\nthe MD four hashing algorithm. So they hashed it up to where it\nwill look something like this. And that's what they store as your\npassword. It's not your password, it's a hashed version of it.\nAnd when you try to log in, they put that back through their little\ncalculation algorithm thing, their hash, and if it spits out the same hash\nthat they have stored, you're in, we want that hash, we need it. And while it won't immediately tell us\nhis password, it will we'll crack it. And actually later I'll show you how we\ncan just use the hash itself to do some pretty gnarly things. It's kind of crazy. Now to get his hash it's found in his\nsystems registry is in two places. Let's get it real quick. I'll go to\nmy search bar and search for reg edit. There it is right there. Notice\nI am getting a UAC prompt. I do have to be administrator. Good news\nis Michael is an administrator here. We're looking at the H key local machine\nand we want the SAM and system keys. Now I could export them here, but we\ndon't have time. We have to hurry up. So we're gonna do it via command live. I'm gonna launch my terminal\nas administrator and with\none command I can grab them. There'll be Reg\nSave, specify the key hq, L M Sam, and then I'll specify where to\nsave it. I'll just put it right here. sam.save. Got it. Same thing for\nthe system. We'll grab system, save at the system, save. And\nwe got it. Wait, is that him? All right, I gotta be quick,\ngive you back at any time. But I have to tell you how you can\nprotect yourself from bad passwords with Dashlane. Dashlane is my password manager of choice\nand the sponsor of this video. Now, I really hope that Michael has been\nusing Dashlane for his Windows password. Actually, I kind of hope he has it. It's gonna make my job so\nmuch harder to hack it. Now I love Dashlane because they make\nit really easy to create complicated, hard to hack passwords\nfor all your services. And I'll tell you if\nit's not a good password, and I'll make sure you have a\nunique password for everything. That's probably the main\nreason people get hacked. I'm really curious what Michael's\npassword is. We're gonna find out. Now, honestly, I should already know if Michael is using\ncode passwords because I forced all of my employees to use Dashlane\nbecause I use it for my business, I can look at their password\nscores, make sure they're healthy, and make sure their passwords\naren't compromised on the dark web. So check it out, link below\ndashlane.com/network. Chuck 50, or you can use Code Network.\nChuck 50 and you'll get 50% off. Don't be like Michael, don't get hacked.\nOkay, he's, he's coming back soon. Okay, let's look at, get this going. Now all you gotta do is\nput this on a flash drive, which I'm just not realizing I don't\nhave. I'll be right back. Let's go. There's a flash. Drive. Uh, crap. Crap crap, crap crap. Got one. Okay, go, go, go, go, go. No. Okay. Alright. Okay. I'll open up my finder right\nhere. Copy these two files, save them to our flash drive, our\nexternal hard drive and we're good to go. All right, I. Think, I think I hear. Him coming. Get it. He doesn't even know what a sucker. Okay, I got 'em. I'm gonna go plug\n'em in my computer's in my server room And there it is. And there they\nare. Sam, save system, save. I'm gonna take those copy and I'll paste\nthem right here on my desktop. Bam. There they are. I'll jump to my\ndesktop and my terminal CD desktop. There's my two files. Now to\nget the hash outta these guys, we're gonna use a tool called Unpack\nIt Secrets Dump. It's a weird name. It's built in the Cali, let's try it\nout. And if you need to install it, of course pseudo A P T. Let's just do a search before unpack\nit and you can find it pretty easily. Here's the command, unpack it,\nsecrets dump. We'll do a dash sam, which is where Windows actually\nstores these Ntlm Hashes. Ntlm is their net logon manager. It's, it manages the password stuff and\nwe'll specify our files, Sam save. And then we'll do dash system\nand specify our system. Save and local because we're\nparsing local files right here. And let's try it out. , do\nyou see all that? There's a lot here. Let me uh, make this more legible for\nyou. We have the hashes by the way, we got the administrator hash\nand there's Michael right there. The hash is actually right here.\nThis is what we need and we have it. So I'm gonna grab this and save it.\nCreate a file called hashes dot txt, paste it in there, control\nxy, enter to save. We got it. Now at this point we have the hash\nand we need to crack the password. And if you see my password cracking video, which if you haven't yet go check it out. I detail a lot of what password cracking\nentails. This is what it normally is. You have a password hash and now we have\nto guess what a password might be for that. If you recall from our example\nearlier, we're kind of like Microsoft, the Windows computer. All we have is the hash and instead of\nwaiting for a user to put the password in and go, yep, that's it. We're gonna try a bunch of\npasswords like a lot and try and guess what the password. Thankfully we have tools that can automate\nthat and they'll be able to tell us what the right password is. But we\ngotta do a few things to make it work. First we'll need a list of passwords,\nthat could be Michael's password. And when I say a list, I mean like\nthousands, probably 20,000 passwords. How do we do that? There's a tool for\nit. I'll show you here in a second. But what we're doing here, getting a list of passwords and trying\nthem all with a tool that's called a dictionary attack. And it's what\nmost password crackers hackers use. So when you hear about a data breach and\npeople you know have their emails and their passwords compromised, it's normally\nan email address and a password hash. And these hackers will do\nwhat I'm doing right now, get a bunch of well known passwords or\nrandomly generated passwords and just start going at it automated.\nLet's try it real quick. Now, to generate our list of passwords,\nwe're gonna use a tool called Cup, which is really, really fun. Check it\nout. Let's see if I have it installed. Nope, , do I wanna install\nit? Sure, yes. Cool, that was easy. So what we'll do here is we'll type in\ncup dash I for interactive mode and what this will do is ask us questions about\nour target name, date, birth date, significant other hobbies, keywords. And we'll use that information to\ngenerate a random list of passwords. Well, not so random, so let's try it\nout. First name Michael surname, wall nickname Michael, we wanna do\nbirthday partner's. Name Amanda Panda. Asher pet's name, Bree\nCompany name Network Shock.\nDon want some keywords? Sure, let's do um Beatles. He likes the Beatles. Summer 2023 Monkeys Bible. Jesus. Okay, I think we're good.\nSpecial characters. Sure, yeah, let's do that leap mode. Dunno what\nthat is saying. No. Okay, , do you see that? That was so fast. It just generated 17,000 words and put\nit inside a file called Michael Txt. Let's, um, let's cat that real\nquick. Cat Michael txt . Look at all that possible\npasswords that he might have. So now let's see if he has that password. For this we're gonna use a\nvery popular cracking tool, password cracking tool called Hash Cat. I go deeper into how to use this\nin my password hacking video. So we'll start our command,\nwe'll do a pseudo hash cat, we'll do a dash m to specify our hash\ntype. We're doing ntlm so it'll be 1000. That's again what Windows uses. I\nknow this from reading the man page. Then we'll specify our hashes. We created a hash file called hashes\ntxt with Michael's hash in it. And then finally our dictionary,\nour word list, Michael Txt. Let's see how this works. Ready, set,\ngo. 17,000 passwords. Let's try it. Okay, there we go. Status cracked. Let's do that same command and we'll do\na dash dash show and it should output for us the hash and the password\nin its database. Okay, there it is. That should be his password. So we\nhave his hash, we have his password. Now what do we do? We hack\nhim , we get in. We can use tools like Evil dash win rm, which is as fun as it sounds. We'll\ndo a dash. I specify his IP address. Now I do happen to know this because\nhe's here at my office, right? And I could've figured that out doing\nIP config while I was at his computer. So that's his IP address.\nDo use your name, Michael dash P I'll put in that password\nwe found and let's see what happens.  Shell right there. Who am I? I'm\nMichael, I'm in his computer right now. Yep, that's his IP address. That's a\nWindows machine. Pretty crazy, right? We can do something better. Let\nme exit outta there. We can uh, RDP with a tool X, free rdp do a forward slash B\nfor the computer slash u for the user password. And that should be all I need. Let's\ntry it out. Seems to be working . What heck got him? How cool is that though? Now let\nme show you something crazier. We cracked the password and I happen to\nknow Michael so I could have generated that list and, and you know, had\na pretty good list of passwords, but we don't need it. Check it out.\nOur same command before Evil WIN rm, we could just do a dash h. Let\nme open up a new terminal and uh, grab that real quick.\nWe'll grab that hash. Oh wait, that's not it. It's\na capital H. Did you see that? I logged in with the hash, not even the\npassword. That's kind of crazy, right? It's called pass the hash. And we\ncan do the same thing with uh, rdp, same command as before, but instead of dash or slash p we'll\ndo a PT for pass the hash paste the hash there , there's a fly in\nhere. Got here fly. But look, it worked. How amazing is that? Oh, I lost it.\nTry it again back again. . He's gotta be freaking out right now. So what I just showed you is how you can\nget a hash from a Windows computer and figure out the password from that hash\nor just use the hash itself to get access to a bunch of stuff. It's kind of\ncrazy. It's powerful, it's really fun. But now let's move on to the\ndefensive side of things. Let's talk about mitigation. And this is actually good news for\nsecurity people because the method that I used here is already documented pretty\nwell in the Mitre meter framework OS credential dumping with\nsecurity account manager, sorry, this flies driving me nuts.\nYou'll notice that hey, we're dumping the same keys\n that they're mentioning. So it's documented and they're even\nsaying the tools that we may have used.  secrets dump What? But what's cool is they do\noffer mitigations disabling\nor restricting N tlm, putting in password\npolicies, user training, and they also give you detection stuff\nlike you actually detect when people are doing stuff with their registry\nkeys. So that's good news. And also full disclosure, we had to do a few things to\nMichael's PC to make this work, disable certain security features\nthat prevented us from doing things. Now we did get the hash, no problem,\nwe didn't have to do anything for that. But in order for me to do the\nWIN RM command giving me a shell, I had to disable his firewall,\nthe Windows firewall, in order for me to do the\nR dp. Same thing, firewall. I also had to enable remote desktop\nand add Michael to the allowed users to access remote desktop and had to\ndisable a setting in the registry called Disable restricted admin, which was a flaw back in Windows\neight that they had to fix. So we did have to do a few\nthings to make it work. So if you try to do this\nyourself and you're like, uh, I'll put some information down below how\nyou can like do this yourself with your own little lab, it's pretty fun. But just know default security\nposture of windows, it's pretty good. Now it doesn't mean that what I've done\nhere cannot be done by a pretty good hacker or that a user may just\nhave a computer that's wide open. So I hope in this video you saw another\nwindow  into windows of how vulnerable we kind of are, but\nalso how secure we are as well. And also I wanted to address something\nbecause back in my password hacking video, now I talked about, oh we\ncan, we can crack hashes, but you're, the number one question I got was\nhow do you get those hashes? Well, in this video I showed you how you could\nget those hashes at least a potential way. And by the way, I've only scratched\nthe surface of what you can do here. This is a very basic example, a basic\ndemo. There's a whole big world to this. That's all I got. I'll\ncatch you guys later."
